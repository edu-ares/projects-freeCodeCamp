                “Rondon is one of the biggest heroes of this country. I say that heroes are the ones who give to humanity, who transform humanity for the better, and leave examples of ethics, of justice, of work. Those are the greatest heroes of life.” - Sydney Possuleo, a Brazilian explorer, activist, and ethnographer in the vein of Rondon
